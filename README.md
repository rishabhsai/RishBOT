## üîí Privacy Features

- **Local Processing (Essay Writer, Problem Solver):** Features like the Essay Writer and Problem Solver process all data locally using Ollama, ensuring your information remains on your machine.
- **Cloud Processing (Screen Content Recognition):** Due to the intensive nature of screen image analysis, this feature utilizes OpenAI's cloud-based AI models. Screen image data is sent to OpenAI for processing. We prioritize transparency and user consent for this functionality.
